I"<p>I had the opportunity to attend an excellent talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/getify" target="_blank">Kyle Simpson</a> at this year’s Web Unleashed when he describes how it’s like to work in isolated communities in rural India or Africa. My own experiences also add up to that: I was born in a very small town in rural Brazil and, to this day, visiting Granny means having to deal with a very slow 2G network that only arrived 5 years ago. <strong>Data is a commodity</strong> there and it comes with a steep price.</p>
