With fast turnarounds in a dynamic workplace, I have to challenge my (soft and hard) skills daily. This project for The Rec Room is one good example of the work we have been developing so far.</h3>

<p>The challenge here was to build a Now Hiring page for The Rec Room’s new job fairs at Mississauga and St John’s according to the brand’s tone of voice  — also enticing potential employees to apply for the soon to be opened positions. The time frame? A few hours.</p>

<p>Using The Rec Room’s branding guide as the main reference, I was able to build a one-page scroller with all the information requested by our stakeholders. Since I had a blank canvas to work with here, leveraging Bulma’s built-in columns layout was fundamental to achieve the desired result in such a short time frame.</p>

<p>With no formal design system in place for the brand, I created the interface elements on the fly based on the existing Branding guide — an interesting process that served as a base to discuss how the brand could behave online moving forward.</p>
