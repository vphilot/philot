### I designed and developed this wep app as the final project for the Web Development II course. It was a great opportunity to challenge my skills as an aspiring front end developer and play around with different web technologies and JS libraries.

The Sónar +D 2018 website works as a Single Page Application that can transfer data and update its elements based on user input. For the View components, I'm using a very straightforward implementation of HTML5, SASS, and Javascript. Thanks to Vincent Garreau for the amazing [Particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/ "Particles.js") library that allowed me to implement a randomly generated particle background for the home screen.

When communicating the state of users' choices (attending, not attending), I used Firebase to store these options and JS to update and refresh the visual states of the HTML elements. This project taught me that managing states in Javascript is not an easy task, and although I was really satisfied with the results, I eventually decided to get into Angular and React to manage these updates more seamlessly.

I developed the UX/ Visual Design system along with the web development itself, which is pretty unusual but I had to pull off due to time constraints. I wanted the website to act as a frame for its content, in a very simple and minimalistic fashion. I believe the final outcome speaks edgy and forward-thinking, reflecting exactly the values of what Sónar is all about.
